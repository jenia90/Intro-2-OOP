Most of the format is:
<cmd> <value> <result to expect>

For example: Both of lines should return true.
	add 5 true
	contains 5 true

Commands:
	add
	contains
	delete
	minNodes										(minNodes method..)
	print											(Print the tree)
	iter											(To check if the tree iterator is working properly)
	size											(tree size)
	copy											(Copies a tree and uses it afterwards to add values etc.)
	data <int1> <int2> ... <intk>					(Data constructor, data keyword before numbers)
	<int1> <int2> ... <intk>						(Data constructor, only numbers)
	""												(Default constructor, empty line.)
	c												(Default constructor)
	stress							(Will add 100,000 upto size 100,000 elements to your tree and see if it dies - Thanks to Dotan Nir :D)
	stressdel							(same as stress but only with deletion, will try to delete existing elements from your tree. (will try to delete most of them))
	init 							( Will reset the tree, default constructor again in-run)
	wreck								(Really crazy command, use on your own risk.)
								wreck command will add roughly 300,000 elements and try to delete most of them.

NOTE: # - at the start of a line is a comment.
NOTE2: You can leave blank lines to make it easier to read, ONLY AFTER YOU CALLED CONSTRUCTOR.
		HOWEVER PREFER using # instead of a blank line.

Obeys format: <cmd> <value> <result>
	add
	contains
	delete
	minNodes

Obeys format: <cmd> <result>:
	size <int>

Obeys format: <cmd>
	c - DEFAULT Constructor. 'c' only. will ignore other words after it.
	"" - DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR. empty line in file.
	init - resets the tree, default constructor in-run
Obeys format: <cmd> <int1> <int2> <int3> ... <intk>
					or
			<int1> <int2> <int3> ... <intk>

	data - Constructs with data.
	<int1> <int2> <int3> ... <intk>

To copy a tree to another: after putting values in a tree use:
	copy       - copies tree1 to tree2 and assigns tree1 = tree2;
	iter
	print
	stress 		- Adds 100,000 elements to your tree and tests its 'add' endurance.
	stressdel   - same as stress but only with deletions. Takes elements from your tree and deletes most of them.
