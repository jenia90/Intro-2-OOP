=============================
The main design of the behaviour of space ships was done according to the course guidelines.
Further explanations and considerations are explained in the implementation details part.

Few words about the DrunkardShip and the SpecialShip designs:
The DrunkardShip doesn't control it's behaviour well so it randomly turns\shoots\accelerates and teleports.

The SpecialShip can copy the behaviour of other ships and it does so in a random manner. Every set number of rounds it chooses
different strategy to copy.

=  Implementation details   =
=============================
In my design i chose to implement the SpaceShip class as an abstract class. This way most of the common functions dealing with
ship's "under the hood" behaviour are implemented in a common super class.
The only abstract method is the doAction because each ship has different in game behaviour so it has to be different for each
inherited class (Space Ship).
When each class is initialized it calls the reset method. This way I didn't have to duplicate code for resetting each of the
SpaceShips' parameters.

To implement the SpecialShip I had to place other SpaceShips' strategy implementations inside the SpaceShip class. This way i didn't
have to duplicate large chunks of code. So each SpaceShip inherited class calls its respectively named method.
